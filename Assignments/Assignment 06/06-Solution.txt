Exercise 6.1:
=========================
The entire solution is placed in the folder RegexTemplate/Regex and is in the form of a Visual Studio project called Regex
The abstract syntax can be found in Absyn.fs

Sub Exercise 1.1
The solution can be found in ReLex.fsl

Sub Exercise 1.2
The solution can be found in RePar.fsy

Sub Exercise 1.3
The solution can be found in Parse.fs

Sub Exercise 1.4
I send the project to F# Interactive. Write OpenParseAndRun;;

1)
> fromString("'a' | 'b' *");;
val it : Absyn.re = Choice (Char 'a',Star (Char 'b'))

2)
> fromString("'a'|'b'*");;
val it : Absyn.re = Choice (Char 'a',Star (Char 'b'))

3)
> fromString("'a' * 'a' 'a'");;
val it : Absyn.re = Seq (Seq (Star (Char 'a'),Char 'a'),Char 'a')

> fromString("'a' 'b' * | 'c'");;
val it : Absyn.re = Choice (Seq (Char 'a',Star (Char 'b')),Char 'c')

4)
> fromString("( 'a' ('b' *) ) | 'c'");;
val it : Absyn.re = Choice (Seq (Char 'a',Star (Char 'b')),Char 'c')

5)
> fromString("( ('a' 'b') * | 'b') *");;
val it : Absyn.re = Star (Choice (Star (Seq (Char 'a',Char 'b')),Char 'b'))

Sub Exercise 1.5
Lexer: Special to note is that e parses to epsilon, the same does '' for example "'a'e'a'''". But to allow for this, I had to make the lexing of characters to require them to be surrounded by ''. To begin with I allowed for regexes of the type "ab|c". Unfortunately the lexer does not support matching on special characters as a Char such as '-' or '*', and lexing will fail. An example could be "'a'|'*'". The lexer only supports a-z, A-Z and 0-9.

Par: The most notable obstacle to create the parser was to get precedence correct. To allow for Choice to be matched first, then sequences and then star, I had to create three parsertypes. Re which matches choice, Res which matches Seqences and then a ReFinal which matches the rest of the types. If Paranthesis are present Re is used again on the regular expression inside.

Exercise 6.2:
=========================
In HigherFun.fs I have added the following function

let check (e : expr) : bool = 
    let rec inner (eNew : expr) (env:string list) : bool =
        match eNew with
        | CstI i -> true
        | CstB b -> true
        | Var x  -> List.exists (fun y -> y=x) env
        | Prim(ope, e1, e2) -> 
          let v1 = inner e1 env
          let v2 = inner e2 env
          v1 && v1
        | Let(x, eRhs, letBody) ->
          let letEnv = x :: env 
          inner eRhs env && inner letBody letEnv
        | If(e1, e2, e3) ->
            let v1 = inner e1 env
            let v2 = inner e2 env
            let v3 = inner e3 env
            v1 && v2 && v3
        | Letfun(f, x, fBody, letBody) -> 
          let bodyEnv = f :: env
          let fBodyEnv = x :: bodyEnv
          inner fBody fBodyEnv && inner letBody bodyEnv
        | Call(eFun, eArg) -> 
          inner eFun env && inner eArg env
    inner e []
